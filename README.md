AI Image Forensics Analyzer
An advanced forensic tool designed to detect and attribute AI-generated images by analyzing their intrinsic digital fingerprints. In an era where visual reality can be easily manipulated, this project provides a robust framework for distinguishing between authentic and synthetic media.



üéØ The Problem
The rise of sophisticated AI models like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion has made it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real photographs and AI-generated images. Traditional forensic methods are often insufficient because they fail to detect the subtle, embedded artifacts created by these models. This creates significant vulnerabilities for the spread of disinformation, copyright infringement, and deepfake-related fraud. This tool addresses that gap by providing a reliable method for source attribution.

‚ú® Key Features
This tool employs a multi-layered analytical approach to provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of an image's origin.

Metadata Analysis: Extracts and scans EXIF, XMP, and other metadata fields for keywords and signatures related to AI generation tools.

Hexadecimal Pattern Detection: Analyzes the binary structure of image files to identify unique byte sequences and file headers inserted by AI models.

Noise Pattern Analysis: Differentiates between natural sensor noise from a camera and the computational artifacts characteristic of generative algorithms.

Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT): Examines the frequency spectrum of an image to detect hidden patterns, watermarks, or anomalies that point to artificial origins.

Error Level Analysis (ELA): Identifies discrepancies in JPEG compression levels across an image to reveal potential manipulations.

Unified Probability Score: Aggregates the results from all analysis modules to produce a single, coherent probability score, indicating whether an image is authentic or AI-generated.

üî¨ How It Works
The core of this project is a multimodal forensic methodology that assumes every AI-generated image, despite its visual realism, contains unique and recognizable digital fingerprints. Instead of relying on a single detection method, the system integrates several analytical layers.

This tiered approach creates a more resilient and accurate framework. By combining evidence from metadata, file structure, noise patterns, and frequency domains, the system can provide a more robust verdict that is less susceptible to simple manipulations or single-point failures.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system is built on a three-tiered architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Presentation Layer: A clean, web-based user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily upload images and view analysis results. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints.

Business Logic Layer: The core of the application, written in Python. This layer contains all the forensic modules (Metadata Analyzer, Hex Detector, Noise Analyzer, etc.) that perform the actual analysis.

Data Access Layer: Manages access to the database of known AI signatures, model fingerprints, and analysis results.

Backend: Python, Flask (for the web API)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
